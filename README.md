🚚 Food Delivery Data Integration & Analysis


📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world data engineering task: consolidating fragmented data from multiple sources into a single, analysis-ready dataset. The goal was to merge transactional data with user and restaurant master records to provide a comprehensive view of food delivery operations.


📂 Data Sources
The project utilizes three distinct file formats to simulate a heterogeneous data environment:

➡️ orders.csv: Transactional data containing order_id, user_id, restaurant_id, and order amounts.

➡️ users.json: User master data including names, emails, and membership tiers.

➡️ restaurants.sql: Restaurant master data containing names and cuisine types.

🛠️ Technical Workflow

1.  Data Loading: Utilized pandas for CSV/JSON and sqlite3 for SQL database extraction.

2.  Data Merging:

    Performed a Left Join between Orders and Users using user_id.

    Performed a Left Join between the result and Restaurants using restaurant_id.

    Note: Left Joins were used to ensure 100% retention of transactional order data.

3.  Final Export: Generated a consolidated file named final_food_delivery_dataset.csv.

📈 Key Insights Captured

By combining these datasets, we can now answer critical business questions such as:

   Which cuisine types drive the highest revenue?

   How do order frequencies differ across various membership tiers?

   Which users are most active in specific restaurant categories?

🚀 How to Run

  1.  Clone this repository.

  2.  Ensure you have pandas installed: pip install pandas.

  3.  Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to generate the final dataset.
